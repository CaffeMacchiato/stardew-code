create a bunch of products (dishes, jewelry, clothing, etc) that can be crafted by putting the required materials into buildings called "workshops" 
-> (additionally, make mini workstations similar to the existing cheese press such as a sewing machine, anvil, etc)
--> BASED OFF OF IN-GAME TIME, NOT REAL-TIME LIKE HARVEST TOWN
===========
keep individual levels for skills like foraging, farming, mining, fishing, combat AND add a new "total" farm experience level which unlocks different areas of the farm
-> also new crafting recipes --> maybe include a chance to find them randomly, like the notes in a bottle from Animal Crossing New Horizons
===========
include more random/chance events:
- make shaking trees more incentivizing by adding a chance for random furniture to be found in a tree
- chance for a beehive to fall from a tree you're shaking for loot or trying to chop down
- chance for a small amount of coins to fall from a tree
===========
add bug catching!!! acnh inspired
- villager who's specialized in entomology (bugs) who gives you a bug net, just like Willy the fisherman giving you a fishing rod
- upgrade bug nets to be bigger and catch different kinds of bugs
===========
add our own tropical island, similar to acnl and ginger island
- catch special fish and bugs only available on the island
- able to repair a resort on the island
- able to repair a house on the island and create a farm for exclusive tropical fruits
===========
add fossils, maybe make a minigame to unearth them
- different fossils in different areas of the map
===========
create a huuuge museum, not just for artifacts and gemstones, but also for paintings(?), fossils, bugs, and fish 
===========
add a coffee shop and cafe (just to make it extra cute)
===========
- add a delivery van for deliveries to gain coins, friendship with the villagers, and experience points for the farm level
- add boat shipments (create a harbor in the beach area)
- add train shipments (expand the train station in stardew)
- add air cargo (create an airport)
===========
add vehicles and a larger city and forest to explore once you've explored the town
===========
make the farm map beautiful, forest-inspired (cottagecore UwU)
