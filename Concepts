Create a dating mechanic that overhauls the original dating mechanic.
Incentivize the player to go on dates by having rewards given to them after each mile stone.
Have the rewards be more and more substantial and rare the further down the line they go with the relationship.
Add scripted cutscenes that allows the player to experience and relate to the character they want on a more emotional level.
Give choices to the player during dates and add mini games for the player to complete (Beat rhythm game, ski-ball, pool, fight game and etc etc..).
Have the NPCs fall in love with the player if the player does certain things (for example: Abigail may fall in love if she found out that the player spends most of their time in the mines collecting gems and keeping them).
Have a mechanic for the NPC to visit the player in their farm and kiss them or offer help.
Add crushes to the game.
Add a new building for multiplayer so that up to 4 people can go on dates in a separate game world where they go on dates with the person they can go on a date with (probably would not allow anyone to go on a date if the entire server is not on agreement of dating that day, simmilar to how festivals work!).
Add a player proposal feature to the game where the NPC can propose to the player if they fell harder for the player than the player is for them.
